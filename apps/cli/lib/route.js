/**
 * CLI routing decisions, extracted so they're independently testable.
 *
 * `infernet` follows the claude / codex / qwen UX convention: bare
 * positional input that isn't a known subcommand is treated as a
 * chat prompt. This keeps `infernet "what is 2+2"` and
 * `echo "…" | infernet` working without forcing users to remember
 * the `chat` keyword.
 *
 * Routing rules (in order):
 *
 *   1. argv[0] in {help, --help, -h}                      → help
 *   2. argv empty + TTY  (`infernet` with no input)       → help (don't
 *                                                          surprise the
 *                                                          user with a
 *                                                          chat REPL)
 *   3. argv empty + piped stdin  (`echo … | infernet`)    → chat
 *   4. argv[0] is a known subcommand                      → that command
 *   5. argv[0] is anything else                           → chat with
 *                                                          all of argv as
 *                                                          the prompt
