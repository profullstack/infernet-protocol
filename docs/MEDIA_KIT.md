# Infernet Protocol media and reference kit

Infernet Protocol is an open-source decentralized GPU inference marketplace. GPU providers can run a local node, register with a hosted or self-hosted control plane, and accept inference jobs. Nodes authenticate with Nostr/secp256k1 signed HTTP requests instead of carrying database credentials.

## Short description

Infernet Protocol is an open-source decentralized GPU inference marketplace for renting, operating, and coordinating GPU capacity across cloud, edge, and self-hosted machines.

## Longer description

Infernet Protocol connects GPU providers, model operators, and inference consumers through a self-hostable control plane, signed node APIs, crypto-native payments, and a provider runtime that can run on cloud GPUs, home labs, and edge machines. The hosted control plane is available at https://infernetprotocol.com, while the codebase is published at https://github.com/infernetprotocol/infernet-protocol.

## Technical facts

- Open-source monorepo for the web dashboard, CLI, daemon, SDK packages, Docker provider image, and protocol documents.
- Next.js control plane with Supabase-backed data APIs.
- GPU nodes authenticate with Nostr/secp256k1 signed HTTP requests.
- Node configs do not need Supabase service-role credentials.
- Provider nodes can run via one-line install, Docker, or manual git clone.
- IPIP process tracks protocol improvement proposals.
- Multi-coin payment flows are designed around CoinPayPortal.
