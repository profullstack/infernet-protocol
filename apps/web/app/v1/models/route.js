 * OpenAI-compatible model list. Wraps listChatModels() (which

 * documented response shape:
 *
 *   { object: "list", data: [{ id, object, owned_by, created, ... }] }
 *
 * `id` is the model name a caller passes back as `model` in
 * /v1/chat/completions. `owned_by` is "infernet" because we don't
 * track per-provider ownership in the model identity here — model
 * routing happens server-side at job-creation time.
