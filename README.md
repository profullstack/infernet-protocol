# Infernet Protocol

An open-source, peer-to-peer protocol for distributed GPU inference tasks.

Read the whitepaper at [INFERNET-PROTOCOL.md](https://github.com/profullstack/infernet-protocol/blob/master/INFERNET-PROTOCOL.md).

The architecture is outlined in [INFERNET-ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/profullstack/infernet-protocol/blob/master/INFERNET-ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (v10 or later)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) (for mobile development)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (for Android development)
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (for iOS development, macOS only)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/profullstack/infernet-protocol.git
cd infernet-protocol
pnpm install
```

### Core Protocol

To run the core protocol server:

```bash
pnpm start
```

For development with auto-restart:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Desktop Application

The desktop application uses Electron with Svelte for the UI.

```bash
cd desktop
pnpm install
```

For development (runs both Vite dev server and Electron):

```bash
pnpm electron:dev
```

To build the desktop application:

```bash
pnpm electron:build
```

### Mobile Application

The mobile application uses React Native with Expo.

```bash
cd mobile
pnpm install
```

To start the Expo development server:

```bash
pnpm start
```

To run on Android or iOS:

```bash
pnpm android
# or
pnpm ios  # macOS only
```

### PocketBase Integration

All applications (desktop, mobile, and PWA) use PocketBase for data management. They connect to a remote P2P instance to seed nodes from https://infernet.tech/nodes.

The API exposes a public `/nodes` route when running in server mode.

## PWA & Self-Hosting

The Progressive Web App (PWA) is designed for GPU/CPU farm operators who need to manage their infrastructure through a web interface.

### PWA Development

The PWA uses Svelte 4 and Hono.js, sharing components with the desktop app where possible:

```bash
cd web
pnpm install
pnpm dev  # Start development server
```

To build the PWA for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

### Self-Hosting Mode

The application can be self-hosted on a server:

```bash
cd web
pnpm build
pnpm start:server  # Start production server
```

### Docker Support

For containerized deployment:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t infernet-protocol -f docker/Dockerfile .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 8080:8080 --gpus all infernet-protocol
```

This is particularly useful for GPU farm operators who need to manage multiple machines.

## USE CASES

The Infernet Protocol enables a decentralized marketplace for AI computation resources, with two primary use cases that leverage Lightning Network (LN) for micropayments:

### 1. Resource Provider: Donating or Renting GPU/CPU Time

As a resource provider in the Infernet Protocol network, you can:

- **Monetize Idle Computing Resources**: Convert underutilized GPU/CPU capacity into a source of passive income by offering it to the network
- **Earn Lightning Network Payments**: Receive instant micropayments in Bitcoin via the Lightning Network for every computation task your hardware processes
- **Set Custom Pricing Models**: Define your own pricing based on hardware capabilities, availability schedules, and computation types
- **Build Reputation**: Establish a reputation score based on reliability, speed, and quality of service, attracting more clients
- **Join Specialized Pools**: Participate in specialized computation pools for specific AI model types or industries
- **Flexible Participation**: Choose between full-time operation or casual participation during off-hours

The desktop application and PWA provide comprehensive dashboards for monitoring earnings, hardware utilization, and reputation metrics.

### 2. Resource Consumer: Training and Inference on the P2P Network

As a consumer of computing resources, you can:

- **Access Distributed Computing Power**: Tap into a global network of GPUs and CPUs without capital investment in hardware
- **Pay-as-You-Go with Lightning**: Pay only for the actual computation used via instant Lightning Network micropayments
- **Scale Dynamically**: Easily scale your computation needs up or down based on project requirements
- **Select Specialized Hardware**: Choose specific hardware profiles optimized for your particular AI models
- **Prioritize Jobs**: Adjust pricing to prioritize urgent computation tasks
- **Distribute Workloads**: Split large jobs across multiple providers for faster processing
- **Ensure Privacy**: Leverage secure computation options for sensitive data processing

The mobile and web applications provide intuitive interfaces for submitting jobs, tracking progress, and managing budgets.

### Lightning Network Integration

The Infernet Protocol uses Lightning Network for all transactions, enabling:

- **Instant Micropayments**: Process payments in milliseconds with minimal fees
- **Trustless Operation**: No need for credit checks or deposits - pay only for what you use
- **Global Accessibility**: Anyone with internet access and Bitcoin can participate
- **Programmable Payments**: Automated payments based on computation metrics
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Transactions don't require revealing personal information

This payment infrastructure allows for truly decentralized AI computation marketplace that operates efficiently at global scale.
