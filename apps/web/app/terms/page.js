                            Infernet Protocol (&ldquo;Infernet&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;) is an
                            open-source peer-to-peer GPU compute marketplace. <code>infernetprotocol.com</code>{" "}
                            is one (the default) control plane. Operators run GPU nodes; clients submit
                            inference and training jobs; payments settle in cryptocurrency between operator
                            and client.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By using <code>infernetprotocol.com</code>, the <code>infernet</code> CLI, or
                            participating in the network in any role, you agree to these Terms.

                            You must be at least 18 years old and legally able to enter into a contract in
                            your jurisdiction. You are responsible for the security of your account
                            credentials, your CLI bearer tokens, and any keys associated with your operator
                            identity (Nostr keypair, payout wallets).

                            protocol is permissionless and not under our control.

                            Payments flow directly between client and operator in cryptocurrency, settled
                            via the configured payment processor (today, CoinPayPortal). Wallets are
                            non-custodial except where Lightning balances are held. We are not a bank, not
                            a money transmitter on your behalf, and do not act as an escrow.

                            We do not take a platform spread above the underlying payment-processor fees.
                            Pricing displayed for any job is the price the client agrees to pay; the
                            operator receives the agreed amount minus the processor&apos;s fee.

                            claim. We are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or
                            punitive damages, including lost profits, lost revenue, or lost data.
