title: "Infernet Protocol: A Peer-to-Peer GPU Inference Marketplace"
subtitle: "Technical Whitepaper"
author: "Infernet Protocol"

lang: en-US
abstract: |
  Infernet Protocol is an open, permissionless marketplace for GPU inference.
  Operators install a single CLI tool, register their hardware, and immediately
  begin earning cryptocurrency for every inference job their node completes.
  Consumers pay per request in any supported coin with no account required.
  The network has no native token, no rent extraction, and no central
  coordinator — operators and consumers interact directly through a
  Nostr-signed HTTP protocol built on standard OpenAI-compatible endpoints.
  This paper describes the network's architecture, economic model, security
  properties, and roadmap.

# 1  Introduction

The commoditization of large language models has outpaced the infrastructure
for distributing their compute.  Today's GPU inference market is dominated by
a handful of cloud hyperscalers and purpose-built inference startups, all of
which extract a percentage of every API call, require account creation, and
impose rate limits or geographic restrictions.

Infernet Protocol eliminates these intermediaries.  A node operator with an
NVIDIA or AMD GPU runs one command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://infernetprotocol.com/install.sh | bash
```

Within minutes the node is registered, its hardware fingerprinted, and it
begins bidding on inference jobs.  Consumers send standard OpenAI-compatible
HTTP requests to the network endpoint; the protocol routes each request to a
healthy provider node, returns the response, and records the transaction.
Payment settles in the coin chosen by the consumer; the operator's payout
address is on-chain from day one.

No native token is issued.  No DAO governance is required.  Fees are charged
in the same coin the consumer pays — the protocol takes a small platform fee
at settlement and passes the remainder directly to the operator.

## 1.1  Goals

1. **Zero-friction onboarding** — a GPU node should be earning in under five
   minutes on any Linux server.
2. **Neutral payment rails** — consumers pay in BTC, ETH, SOL, USDC, USDT,
   or a dozen other coins; operators set their preferred payout coin.
3. **No rent extraction** — the protocol's fee is fixed and transparent;
   operators keep the majority of every payment.
4. **Open and auditable** — the full stack (CLI, daemon, control plane,
   payment integration) is MIT-licensed on GitHub.
5. **Hardware-agnostic** — NVIDIA, AMD, and Apple Silicon nodes are all
   first-class citizens.

# 2  Architecture Overview

Infernet Protocol has three layers: the **control plane**, the **P2P network**,
and the **inference engine**.

```

## 2.1  Control Plane

The control plane is a Next.js application backed by Supabase (Postgres).  It
is the only centralized component, and its role is intentionally narrow:

- **Node registry** — stores signed node records (pubkey, GPU specs, model
  list, endpoint, VRAM tier).
- **Job queue** — matches incoming consumer requests to available nodes.
- **Payment ledger** — records payment intents, on-chain confirmations, and
  payout instructions.
- **Routing** — returns a healthy, capable node to the consumer for each
  request; consumers then talk directly to that node.

The control plane never holds private keys, never proxies inference traffic,
and never stores model weights.  Operators may self-host the entire control
plane using the open-source repository.

## 2.2  Node Daemon

Each operator node runs the `infernet` CLI as a background daemon.  The daemon:

1. **Registers** the node by POSTing a Nostr-signed record to the control plane.
2. **Heartbeats** every 30 seconds with current load and availability.
3. **Accepts jobs** forwarded by the control plane and proxies them to the
   local inference engine (Ollama, vLLM, or SGLang).
4. **Reports completion** with token counts and latency metrics.
5. **Auto-upgrades** by checking the npm registry for new CLI versions and
   re-registering after update.

The daemon stores no secrets beyond the operator's Nostr private key, which
never leaves the node.

## 2.3  Nostr Identity and Request Signing

Node authentication uses [Nostr](https://nostr.com) secp256k1 keypairs.
Every node registration, heartbeat, and status update is signed with the
node's private key and verified by the control plane against the public key
stored in the registry.

This design has two properties we consider important:

- **No password database** — the control plane stores public keys only.
  Compromise of the control plane's database does not expose operator credentials.
- **Self-sovereign identity** — an operator can migrate their node to a new
  server without contacting the platform; the keypair travels with them.

CLI device-code login for the web dashboard uses a separate short-lived JWT
derived from a server-side HMAC secret and the operator's verified email.

## 2.4  Inference Engines

The daemon supports three local backends:

| Backend | Best for | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **Ollama** | General-purpose LLMs up to ~70B | Easiest setup; GGUF quantized |
| **vLLM** | High-throughput, full-precision HuggingFace models | Requires CUDA; PagedAttention |
| **SGLang** | Structured generation, long-context models | Supports Llama, Mistral, Qwen |

All three expose an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint.  The
daemon auto-detects whichever is running on standard ports (11434 for Ollama,
8000 for vLLM, 30000 for SGLang).

Operators can also download HuggingFace models directly:

```bash
infernet model pull hf:NousResearch/Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-8B
infernet uncensored   # auto-picks best uncensored model for available VRAM
```

---

# 3  Hardware Classification

Nodes self-report their hardware at registration time.  The daemon uses
`nvidia-smi`, `rocm-smi`, and `/proc/meminfo` to collect:

- GPU model, VRAM (MB), architecture generation
- CPU core count, RAM (MB)
- Operating system and CUDA version

VRAM is bucketed into tiers for routing:

| Tier | VRAM | Typical hardware |
|------|------|-----------------|
| `nano` | < 4 GB | Integrated / low-end mobile GPUs |
| `small` | 4–8 GB | RTX 3060, RTX 4060 |
| `medium` | 8–16 GB | RTX 3080, RTX 4080 |
| `large` | 16–32 GB | RTX 3090, RTX 4090, A100 40 GB |
| `xl` | 32–80 GB | A100 80 GB, H100 80 GB |
| `xxl` | 80 GB+ | Multi-GPU, H100 NVLink clusters |

The routing layer uses these tiers to filter nodes before matching a job.
Operators on shared hosting platforms (Vast.ai, RunPod) are supported
natively; the daemon automatically excludes Docker bridge IPs from its
advertised endpoint.

# 4  Job Lifecycle

   │◀── stream response ───────│──────────────────────│

   │                           │── record payout ────▶│
```

1. **Consumer submits** a chat completion or embedding request to the control
   plane's OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
2. **Routing** selects a healthy node with sufficient VRAM tier and the
   requested model.  Selection prefers lower latency and higher completion
   rate.
3. **Node executes** the inference locally and streams the response back.
4. **Metering** records token counts (prompt + completion) and wall-clock
   latency for billing.
5. **Payment** is settled asynchronously: the consumer's payment intent
   triggers a CoinPayPortal transaction, which webhooks back to the control
   plane on confirmation.
6. **Payout** accumulates in the operator's ledger and can be withdrawn at
   any time to any address they configure via `infernet payout set`.

# 5  Payment Model

## 5.1  No Native Token

Infernet Protocol deliberately issues no native token.  Token issuance
creates misaligned incentives: the platform benefits from token price
appreciation regardless of actual inference utility delivered.  Instead,
operators and consumers transact in established coins with deep liquidity.

## 5.2  Supported Coins

Payment is processed via [CoinPayPortal](https://coinpayportal.com), which
supports:

- **Bitcoin** (BTC) — on-chain and Lightning Network
- **Ethereum** (ETH) and ERC-20 stablecoins (USDC, USDT)
- **Solana** (SOL) and SPL tokens
- **Polygon**, **BNB Chain**, **XRP**, **ADA**, **DOGE**
- Multi-chain USDC and USDT

Operators configure a payout address per coin:

```bash
infernet payout set --coin BTC --address bc1q...
```

The platform converts consumer payments to operator payouts at the prevailing
exchange rate with no spread markup — the platform fee is the only deduction.

## 5.3  Fee Structure

| Party | Amount |
|-------|--------|
| Consumer | Pays per 1 000 tokens (prompt + completion) |
| Operator | Receives ~90% of consumer payment |
| Platform | Retains ~10% as protocol fee |

Exact per-token rates are set by operators within bounds published by the
control plane.  Operators competing for the same job tier drive rates toward
the market equilibrium.

## 5.4  Reputation (CPR)

Completed jobs generate a signed receipt issued to CoinPay's Reputation
Protocol (CPR).  Operators accumulate on-chain reputation scores that affect
their routing priority.  High-reputation nodes receive more job offers; nodes
with repeated failures or timeouts are deprioritized automatically.

---

# 6  Security Model

## 6.1  Control Plane Compromise

If the control plane is compromised, an attacker gains access to:

- The node registry (public keys and endpoint URLs — both already public)
- The job queue and payment ledger (financial metadata, no private keys)
- Consumer email addresses (Supabase Auth)

An attacker does **not** gain:

- Operator Nostr private keys (stored on-node only)
- Model weights (stored on-node only)
- Consumer payment credentials (handled by CoinPayPortal)

## 6.2  Node Impersonation

A malicious actor cannot register a fake node under an existing operator's
identity without possessing the operator's Nostr private key.  All node
mutations (register, heartbeat, update) must be signed; the control plane
rejects unsigned or incorrectly signed requests.

## 6.3  Job Integrity

The control plane does not guarantee inference result integrity in v1.  Output
verification (challenge-response or ZK proof of execution) is on the roadmap
(see §8).  Operators with sustained low accuracy or high refusal rates are
penalized in routing.

## 6.4  Model Key Hierarchy (IPIP-0028)

Each model artifact published to the network is assigned a secp256k1 keypair.
This enables three-party encrypted payloads between consumer, node, and model
— ensuring that sensitive prompts can be encrypted end-to-end with NIP-44
without the control plane being able to read them.  IPIP-0028 is implemented
in the CLI's `model-key.js` module and will be extended as the protocol matures.

# 7  Decentralization Roadmap

Infernet Protocol ships today as a semi-decentralized system: the P2P network
and payment rails are decentralized, but the job queue and node registry live
on a centralized control plane.  The phased roadmap moves progressively toward
full decentralization:

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 0 | Centralized control plane (Supabase + Next.js) | **Shipped** |
| 1 | Nostr-signed node identity; no password database | **Shipped** |
| 2 | Multi-coin payments via CoinPayPortal | **In progress** |
| 3 | Reputation protocol (CPR receipts per job) | **Planned** |
| 4 | Decentralized job queue (Nostr relay or DHT) | **Planned** |
| 5 | ZK proof of inference execution | **Research** |
| 6 | Fully P2P — no required central coordinator | **Research** |

The centralized control plane in Phase 0 is intentional.  Eliminating it
before the economic incentives are proven would sacrifice reliability without
a corresponding user benefit.  Each subsequent phase reduces trust assumptions
while preserving the operator and consumer experience.

---

# 8  Distributed Training

Beyond inference, Infernet Protocol is designed to support distributed model
training across the operator network.  The `infernet train` command (in active
development) will allow:

- **Data collection** — operators contribute curated datasets to training runs.
- **Federated fine-tuning** — gradient updates aggregated across nodes without
  sharing raw training data.
- **Model publishing** — completed models pushed to the InfernetProtocol
  HuggingFace organization for public access.

Training jobs will use the same payment model as inference: consumers pay per
GPU-hour, operators earn per gradient step contributed.

---

# 9  Comparison

| | Infernet Protocol | Centralized API (OpenAI et al.) | Other Decentralized Networks |
|-|-------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Native token required | No | No | Often yes |
| Operator self-custody | Yes | No | Varies |
| OpenAI-compatible API | Yes | Yes | Rarely |
| Multi-coin payments | Yes | No (card / credits) | Single chain |
| Open source | MIT | No | Varies |
| Setup time | < 5 min | Account + billing | Hours–days |
| GPU hardware agnostic | Yes | N/A | Often NVIDIA only |

---

# 10  Getting Started

**As an operator:**

```bash
# Install
curl -fsSL https://infernetprotocol.com/install.sh | bash

# Configure
infernet init

# Register and start earning
infernet register
infernet start
```

**As a consumer:**

Send standard OpenAI-compatible requests to `https://infernetprotocol.com/v1/`
with your API key.  No account required for the public inference endpoint.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://infernetprotocol.com/v1",
    api_key="your-api-key"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="qwen2.5:7b",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

---

# 11  Conclusion

Infernet Protocol demonstrates that a GPU inference marketplace can operate
without a native token, without a centralized owner, and without compromising
the operator or consumer experience.  By grounding identity in Nostr keypairs,
payments in established coins, and inference in standard OpenAI-compatible
APIs, the protocol slots into existing workflows while laying the foundation
for a fully decentralized compute layer.
