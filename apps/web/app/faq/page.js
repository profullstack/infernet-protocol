                        on NVIDIA boxes it installs both Ollama and vLLM; on AMD / Apple

                        run <code>wsl --install -d Ubuntu</code>, install the Windows-side
                        NVIDIA driver (gives WSL CUDA without a separate Linux driver),
                        and then run the same one-liner inside Ubuntu. Outbound paths
                        (chat, remote model commands) work as-is; direct P2P inbound on

                        Ollama is the easy default: works on every GPU vendor + CPU,
                        installs in ~30 s, manages model downloads. Use it for a single
                        GPU, mixed hardware, dev boxes, or if you just want it to work.
                        vLLM is the high-throughput choice for serious NVIDIA hardware:
                        PagedAttention, request batching, native tensor + pipeline
                        parallelism via Ray. Use it when you have multiple GPUs (or a
                        cluster), care about p99 latency under load, or need
                        OpenAI-compatible APIs in a busy production setup. The installer
                        provisions both on NVIDIA so you can switch by which one is
                        running. Auto-select picks vLLM ahead of Ollama if both are up.
